# Zirconium
***Do you like how I dance? I've got Zirconium pants!***

### This is a fork of Zirconium, which aims to be based off `bluefin-nvidia` instead. This is not ready for production use, please use Zirconium linked below.

## What is Zirconium?
Zirconium is an opinionated fedora-bootc image that makes use of Niri and Noctalia to create a usable out of the box TWM experience.

Zirconium is built primarily for container-focused development and day-to-day usage, however gaming is still more than possible. For a fully gaming-focused experience, use Bazzite.

## How do I use this?
**Head over to https://github.com/zirconium-dev/zirconium in order to use actual Zirconium please.**

## What are the differences from the regular one?
Not much, just that I switched the base from Fedora to Bluefin, and made as little changes as necessary to get it to build and work properly.
