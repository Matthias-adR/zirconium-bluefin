# Zirconium
***Do you like how I dance? I've got Zirconium pants!***

### This is a fork of Zirconium, which aims to be based off `bluefin-nvidia` instead. This is not ready for production use, please use Zirconium linked below.

## What is Zirconium?
Zirconium is an opinionated fedora-bootc image that makes use of Niri and Noctalia to create a usable out of the box TWM experience.

Zirconium is built primarily for container-focused development and day-to-day usage, however gaming is still more than possible. For a fully gaming-focused experience, use Bazzite.

## How do I use this?
**Head over to https://github.com/zirconium-dev/zirconium in order to use actual Zirconium please.**

## What are the differences from the regular one?
Not much, just that I switched the base from Fedora to Bluefin, and made as little changes as necessary to get it to build and work properly.

## Can I still customize Niri/Noctalia?
Yes! They do update their dotfiles in OS updates, however you're not forced to use them. They're hoping at some point to be able to make the dotfile update process less destructive. 

## Zirconium is a stupid name. Why did they pick Zirconium?
A weird wax baby made me.
